# Time tracker app

## Description:

Your task is to create a to-do list application using React with hooks and function components, TypeScript, SASS, and HTML5. The application should allow users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

## Requirements:

- Display a list of tasks with checkboxes to indicate completion status.
- Provide an input field and a button to add new tasks to the list.
- Implement functionality to mark tasks as completed when the corresponding checkbox is clicked.
- Include a button or icon next to each task to delete it from the list.
- Apply appropriate styling using SASS to distinguish between completed and pending tasks.
- Use TypeScript for type safety, especially when defining the structure of tasks.

### Optional (if time permits):

- add a dropdown to select category for each todo
- show categories in the todo list
- filter by categories
